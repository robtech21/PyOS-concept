# PyOS-concept
A Linux OS that uses only Python apps on top of the basic framework (proof of concept version)

This is not to be confused with [Pi-OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit) for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)

For now, OS is planned to run under [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org). If all else fails, I will attempt to use [LFS](https://linuxfromscratch.org).
